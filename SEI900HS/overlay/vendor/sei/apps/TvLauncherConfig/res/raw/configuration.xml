	     to display on the Home Screen in place of the Google Search logo.
	     The dimensions for the custom icon can be found on the Android TV UX
	     design guidelines documentation.
	     To replace the default search icon, provide a URI to the bitmap of
	     the icon, this can be a URI to an external server or to a local file

	     at the top row of the Home Screen by setting this flag to true or false.
	
	     enable_input_state_icon (boolean) - OEMs can supply their own icons for
	     each state of each input.
	     This feature can be enabled by setting this boolean flag to true.
	     To supply the icons, OEMs must use the setIcon(Icon icon, int state)
